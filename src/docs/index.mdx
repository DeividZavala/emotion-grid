# Emotion grid

A responsive (mobile-first) grid system built with emotion.

## Installation

Can you use **yarn** or **npm**.

```bash
$ yarn add emotion-grid
```

## Basic Usage

You can create a basic grid system by using a single set of Row and Col grid assembly, all of the columns (Col) must be placed in Row.

```jsx
import { Container, Row, Col } from '@mverissimoo/emotion-grid';

function Page() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <Row>
        <Col xs={4} md={6} xl={12}>
          Col
        </Col>
        <Col xs={4} md={6} xl={12}>
          Col
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </Container>
  );
}

export default Page;
```
